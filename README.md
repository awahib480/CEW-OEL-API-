# CEW-OEL-API-
"A weather data API"

Run the application:
- Run the main.c file
- Or run the shell script file "run.sh"

Working:
The application makes a call to the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data and then saves the raw and processed data in two different files for better accessing. It also detects more or less than normal temperature and gives a popup warning.
